To run the app locally, we need two separate terminals.

In the first terminal:
    1. Go to project directory
    2. Run: npm start
    3. Any code changes you make to front-end will hot-reload!

In the second terminal:
    1. Go to project directly, then cd inside `api` folder
    2. Run: npm start
    3. Any code changes to server will also hot-reload
